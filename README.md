# Adv Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

This is a simple Java console application designed to help a car dealership manage its vehicle inventory. Users can:

- Search for vehicles by price, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type

- View all vehicles in the inventory

- Add new vehicles

- Remove sold vehicles

The app loads dealership data from a CSV file at startup and saves all changes back to the file. It also supports creating Sale and Lease contracts, updating inventory accordingly.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to record a sale so that I can track what vehicle was sold, to whom, and for how much.

- As a user, I want record a lease so that I can track lease agreements, and customer obligations.

- As a user, I want to review contracts so that I have a record of all transactions

- 1: Find vehicles within a price range.
- 2: Find vehicles by make/model.
- 3: Find vehicles by year range.
- 4: Find vehicles by color.
- 5: Find vehicles by mileage range.
- 6: Find vehicles by type.
- 7: List all vehicles.
- 8: Add a vehicle.
